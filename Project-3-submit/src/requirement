7 data servers + 5 clients
communication channels between all 7 servers


when client wants R/W
    make communication channel
    last at least to complete operation


on read, pick random server of the three
    if object not there (no write of this object before read), error code


object on 3 server, H, H+2%7, H+4%7


if channel is disrupt, no message sent
   channel between client server
   channel between server server


on write to that object
    contact server H, if not live go to next, if 2 die, no update on all (check availability first before update)
    update it die?
    give task to that server
    that server update to other servers


make sure no read-write conflict
--------------------------------------------------------------------- DONE UP----------------------------------------------------------

if 2 clients want to write same object, check availability first (need at least 2 online), then do total order on update, same order update on all copies


disable some communication channel to partition to 2
some update can be done on one, some on the others


merge 
	copy from other server
	make sure no write to these Objects
	make sure no read to these Objects of this Server
